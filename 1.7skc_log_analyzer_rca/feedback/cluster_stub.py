def suggest_new_patterns(unmatched_lines):
    """
    Placeholder for a future ML-based log clustering pipeline.

    Intended enhancements:
    - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., Drain3, TF-IDF, DBSCAN)
    - Identify recurring log templates from unmatched lines
    - Suggest regex patterns suitable for use in rules.yml

    This is part of a feedback loop to:
    - Continuously improve coverage of known log patterns
    - Reduce false negatives in signature matching
    - Prepare inputs for future LLM-assisted RCA systems

    Args:
        unmatched_lines (List[str]): Log lines that were not matched by current rules.

    Returns:
        List[str]: Suggestions or templates for new rule candidates.
